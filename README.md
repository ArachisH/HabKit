# HabBit
Command line tool for allowing the user to remove certain restrictions from the Harble client that do not originally allow it to be used locally.

## Requirements
* System32/cmd.exe
* .NET Framework 4.0+

## Getting Started
`(Skip this section if you're cool, onto the list of arguments for you)`  
First things first, download and unzip the latest release somewhere accessible on your computer, excluding your recycle bin.
You can find the latest release here: https://github.com/ArachisH/HabBit/releases

I'll assume you extracted it onto your desktop under a folder named **HabBit**, so with that, let's start up the command prompt.
(Windows Key + R) This key combination will bring up some box, type **cmd** into the input box and hit the **OK**.

Some black box should have appeared, the next step involves changing the current active directory that the console is pointing to. By default, it should be pointing to **C:\Users\{Username}**. We need to change the directory to points towards the folder to where HabBit has been extracted to, to do this use the **cd** command followed by the path. If you didn't extract it to a folder named HabBit onto your desktop, then your path should look different based on where it is.
```
cd C:\Users\{Username}\Desktop\HabBit
```
Congratulations, you can do stuff, we can now run the executable by entering **HabBit.exe** into the command prompt.

| \kshout  | Client will be forced to publicly share the DH(RC4 Stream Cypher) private key to any connected parties.        | None             | **false**            |
| \log     | Call an external function every time a message is being sent/received with the array of values as a parameter. | functionName     | [Optional]           |
| \rev     | Sets the client's revision value found in the Outgoing[4000] message class handler.                            | revision         | [Required]           |
| \rsa     | Override the client's internal public RSA keys.                                                                | rsaKeySize       | [Optional]           |

## Q&A
**Q:** `Why does the argument "\log" have an optional parameter?`  
**A:** This is because internally(in the client), a function name is already provided: [FlashExternalInterface.logDebug](https://github.com/ArachisH/HabBit/blob/90575fdd950a4b447c2a3765ce962eec0d0e4250/HabBit/Habbo/HGame.cs#L623)  

**Q:** `What are the default public/private RSA keys if I use the argument "\rsa" without specifying a key size?`  
**A:** Ideally, you should consider letting it generate your own keys(otherwise why usa RSA if your private key is out there), but here you go:
